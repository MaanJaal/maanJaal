🚀 Hello, I'm [Your Name/Handle]!

Aspiring Cyber Security Professional | Ethical Hacker | Digital Forensics Enthusiast

Welcome to my central hub for projects and portfolio work! I am a passionate and driven student focused on building practical, real-world skills in offensive and defensive security. This profile is where I document my journey, showcase my practical labs, and consolidate my projects.

Primary Goals: Attract recruiters, connect with other cyber security students, and maintain a centralized portfolio.

🎯 My Focus & Expertise

My goal is to transition from academic study into a professional role where I can apply a comprehensive understanding of system vulnerabilities and threat mitigation strategies. I am actively seeking connections with industry professionals and fellow students.

Area of Interest

Description

🛡️ Penetration Testing

Simulating attacks to find and fix vulnerabilities in systems and applications.

🔍 Digital Forensics

Investigating digital devices to recover, analyze, and preserve evidence.

🧠 Threat Intelligence

Analyzing external threats and adversaries to predict and prevent future attacks.

🌐 Network Security

Protecting network infrastructure, including real-time traffic analysis and reconnaissance.

☁️ Cloud Security

Securing data, applications, and infrastructure hosted in public cloud environments.

🔬 Reverse Engineering

Analyzing software binaries to understand functionality and uncover hidden vulnerabilities.

🛠️ Cyber Security Toolkit

I am proficient and actively developing my skills with the following essential tools and technologies:

Operating Systems & Environments

Linux: Ubuntu, Kali Linux (My primary security testing environment)

Programming & Scripting

Python (My preferred language for automating security tasks, developing custom tools, and data processing)

Key Security Tools

Tool Name

Core Functionality Highlight

Nmap

Network reconnaissance for open ports and services, critical for finding entry points.

Wireshark

Deep packet analysis; allows users to see raw data, decode protocols, and examine traffic flow.

Metasploit

Exploitation framework providing a vast database of modules to simulate and verify real-world attacks.

Aircrack-ng

Captures packets and data from Wi-Fi networks for key cracking using dictionary attacks against handshakes.

John the Ripper

CPU-based tool primarily used to test password strength against encrypted hashes (cracking).

Hashcat

GPU-accelerated hash cracking, offering significantly faster cracking speeds against various hash algorithms.

📂 Featured Projects & Labs

These projects demonstrate my practical, hands-on experience in defensive and offensive security:

Custom Network Reconnaissance Script: Developed a powerful Python-based script utilizing Nmap capabilities to automate the discovery of hosts, open ports, and operating system information on a network.

Brute-Forcing & Password Cracking Lab: Hands-on experience with John the Ripper and Hashcat to understand hash algorithms and optimize dictionary/brute-force attacks to test password policy efficacy.

Real-Time Network Traffic Monitor: Utilized Wireshark for deep-dive network analysis, coupled with custom filters to isolate suspicious activity and decode protocols for deep security analysis.

Exploitation Simulation Lab: Employed Metasploit to conduct simulated, controlled attacks against vulnerable targets, focusing on understanding the kill chain and how to effectively manage and patch identified vulnerabilities.

💡 Interesting Cyber Security Fact

I'm fascinated by the concept of steganography—the art of concealing a message, file, image, or video within another message, file, image, or video. It's a subtle form of communication that completely bypasses most traditional security monitoring, making it a critical aspect of forensic analysis.

📧 Let's Connect!

I am always open to collaborating on projects, discussing security challenges, and connecting with industry professionals and fellow students.
